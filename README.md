# ML Projects

This repository contains the ML projects I have worked on. I will be adding to this repository with more projects in the future. The descriptions of the projects are as follows:

Text Classification LSTM Project: For this project, I developed and trained a sequential Long Short Term Memory model using a consumer complaints dataset to classify complaints into class labels of specific services and products. The consumer complaints dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/cfpb/us-consumer-finance-complaints.
